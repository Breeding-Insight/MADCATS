**Marker-Anchored Discovery and Counting of Alleles from Targeted Sequencing.**

`madcats` is a command-line tool that turns targeted-sequencing FASTQs into MADC microhaplotype
count tables. It counts the alleles a panel was designed for and finds additional ones in the reads.
The output is a raw MADC table, which goes through HapApp before dosage calling and VCF conversion.

The same code handles DArTag, AgriSeq (Ion Torrent), GT-seq, rhAmpSeq and Flex-Seq capture data.
It needs only the Python 3 standard library. Every analysis threshold is a command-line option, and
each run writes a JSON file recording its parameters and read counts.

> **A prior MADC is not an input.** Generation uses only the FASTQs plus the assay design: the
> DArTag primer/probe files, a probe design alone, or a platform-neutral Ref/Alt tag manifest.

## Highlights

- **Validated against vendor MADCs**: count correlation r = 0.9997 on DArTag sweetpotato, and
  95–99% dosage agreement across five DArTag panels
- **Three ways to define a panel**: from vendor design files (`madcats design`), from the probe
  design plus reads when the primer file is withheld (`madcats infer-design`), or from any
  hand-curated Ref/Alt tag CSV
- **Evidence-based allele discovery**: a new microhaplotype is reported only when it recurs across
  samples, reaches high depth in one sample, or (optionally) has enough high-quality reads.
  UNOISE-style denoising then removes sequencing errors without changing any sample's Ref/Alt dosage
- **Indel-aware**: designed indels are supported, and undesigned indels are recovered with a gapped
  alignment that caps the number of substitutions and gaps
- **Non-primer-started platforms**: `madcats normalize-reads` orients and windows AgriSeq-style
  reads, and `madcats merge-pairs` handles paired-end data
- **HapApp-ready output**: raw MADC tables with an optional vendor-style preamble for HapApp, which
  prepares them for BIGr and other downstream tools, plus per-row `Variants` / `MarkerType`
  annotations
- **Pure Python, no dependencies**, with parallel processing (`--jobs`) and a reusable per-sample cache

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

Requires Python 3.9 or newer.

```bash
pip install madcats
madcats --help
```

To keep it isolated from other Python packages, use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/):
`pipx install madcats`.

### Pre-built Binaries

Standalone executables that need no Python installation are attached to each
[release](https://github.com/Breeding-Insight/MADCATS/releases):
- `madcats-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`: Linux
- `madcats-macos-x86_64.tar.gz`: macOS (Intel)
- `madcats-macos-aarch64.tar.gz`: macOS (Apple Silicon)

```bash
# Download and extract (example: Linux)
curl -LO https://github.com/Breeding-Insight/MADCATS/releases/latest/download/madcats-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf madcats-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./madcats --help

# Optional: install to PATH
mkdir -p ~/bin && mv madcats ~/bin/
# Add to PATH if not already (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):
# export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Breeding-Insight/MADCATS.git
cd MADCATS
pip install .            # or: python3 madcats.py --help (no install needed)
```

## Quick Start

To try MADCATS on a small simulated project first, see [Try the Example](https://madcats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/example.html).

```bash
# 1) Reconstruct each marker's Ref/Alt tags from the DArTag design files
madcats design \
  --primers panel_primer_sequence.csv \
  --probe-design panel_probe-design.txt \
  --output reference_tags.csv

# 2) Generate the MADC count table from one FASTQ per sample
madcats generate \
  --fastq-dir fastqs/ \
  --reference-tags reference_tags.csv \
  --cache-dir work/cache \
  --jobs 8 \
  --output results/project_MADC.csv

# 3) Optional: compare against a vendor-delivered MADC
madcats validate \
  --generated results/project_MADC.csv \
  --expected vendor_MADC.csv \
  --report results/validation.json
```

No primer file? Infer the panel from the probe design and the reads:

```bash
madcats infer-design \
  --probe-design panel_probe-design.txt \
  --fastq-dir fastqs/ \
  --output reference_tags.csv
```

Reads that are not primer-started (for example AgriSeq on Ion Torrent) are normalized first:

```bash
madcats normalize-reads --probe-design markers.tsv --fastq-dir raw_fastqs/ --out-dir normalized/ --jobs 8
madcats generate --fastq-dir normalized/ --fastq-glob "*.fastq" \
  --reference-tags normalized/window_reference_tags.csv \
  --tag-length 41 --min-supporting-freq 0.10 --output project_MADC.csv
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `madcats design` | Reconstruct Ref/Alt tags from vendor primer + probe-design files |
| `madcats infer-design` | Infer a reference-tag panel from the probe design plus FASTQ evidence |
| `madcats merge-pairs` | Merge overlapping paired-end reads into single fragments |

## Input Formats

### Reference tags (CSV)
The platform-neutral panel definition that `generate` consumes. Produced by `design`,
`infer-design` or `normalize-reads`, or curated by hand.
```
MarkerName,LeftPrimerSequence,RefSequence,AltSequence
Chr01_000123,ACGTTGCAGGTCAAGT,ACGTTGCAGGTCAAGTTCA...,ACGTTGCAGGTCAAGTTCG...
```
`VariantPositionInTagSequence`, `VariantRef`, `VariantAlt`, `RightPrimerSequence` and
`LocusGroup` are optional.

### Probe design (TSV/CSV)
`MarkerName` and `TargetSequence` with one bracketed variant: a SNP such as `[C/T]` or an
anchored indel such as `[A/ACTTG]`.

### FASTQs
One FASTQ (optionally gzipped) per sample in a folder. Sample columns are named by the FASTQ stem,
or by a `--sample-lookup` table.

## Output

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `project_MADC.csv` | MADC table: `AlleleID`, `CloneID`, `AlleleSequence`, summary columns, one read-count column per sample |
| `project_MADC.csv.qc.json` | Parameters, provenance, and per-sample read accounting |
| `project_MADC.csv.variants.csv` | One line per variant event per row (with `--annotations on`, the default) |

## Validation

Each platform was checked against the best independent comparison available for its dataset.
"Genotype agreement" means updog dosage calls made from the MADCATS table (through HapApp and BIGr)
compared with the reference genotypes.

| Platform | Accuracy | Validated against |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| DArTag (sweetpotato, red clover, blackberry, alfalfa, pecan) | count r = 0.9997; dosage agreement 95.4–98.8% | vendor MADC, vendor/updog dosage, families, skim-seq VCF |
| AgriSeq, Ion Torrent (honeybee, oyster) | 94.9% vs Torrent VariantCaller; 98.0% replicate concordance | vendor caller + replicates |
| GT-seq (delta smelt) | 99.49% | independent BWA/bcftools truth VCF |
| Flex-Seq capture (cranberry) | 95.13% genotype agreement | published population VCF + 20 trios |
| rhAmpSeq (8 grape families) | 99.92–99.99% family transmission | Mendelian constraints + same-reads head-to-head |
