**MADCATS** (Marker-Anchored Discovery and Counting of Alleles from Targeted Sequencing) is a
platform-independent command-line tool that turns targeted-sequencing FASTQs into MADC
microhaplotype count tables. It recovers the alleles a panel was designed to detect, discovers the
additional microhaplotypes present in the reads, and writes a raw MADC table. That table goes
through HapApp (or HapApp_utils) before dosage calling and VCF conversion with BIGr and related
tools.

The name also reflects the tool's origins as a FASTQ-to-MADC workflow, where MADC is the
*Missing Allele Discovery Counts* format.

## What can MADCATS do?

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`madcats design`](commands/design.md) | Reconstruct Ref/Alt tags from vendor primer + probe-design files |
| [`madcats infer-design`](commands/infer-design.md) | Infer the panel from the probe design plus reads when the primer file is withheld |
| [`madcats merge-pairs`](commands/merge-pairs.md) | Merge overlapping paired-end reads into single fragments |
| [`madcats normalize-reads`](commands/normalize-reads.md) | Orient and window non-primer-started reads (e.g. AgriSeq) |
| [`madcats window-scan`](commands/window-scan.md) | Choose the tag/window length from the project's own reads |
| [`madcats generate`](commands/generate.md) | Generate the MADC count table |
| [`madcats validate`](commands/validate.md) | Compare a generated MADC against a reference MADC |

## Key Features

- **Open and deterministic**: every threshold is on the command line, and a QC/provenance JSON is
  written beside every result
- **Platform-independent**: validated on DArTag, AgriSeq (Ion Torrent), GT-seq, rhAmpSeq and
  Flex-Seq capture data with the same code
- **Evidence-based discovery**: a new microhaplotype is reported only when the reads support it
  (see the [evidence model](reference/evidence-model.md)), and denoising never changes a sample's
  Ref/Alt dosage
- **Indel-aware**: designed indel markers are fully supported, and undesigned indels are recovered
  with a gapped alignment that caps the number of substitutions and gaps
- **No dependencies**: pure Python 3 standard library, with parallel workers and a reusable
  per-sample cache

## A prior MADC is not an input

Generation uses only the FASTQs plus the assay design: the DArTag primer and probe files, the probe
design alone, or a platform-neutral Ref/Alt tag manifest. A vendor MADC, when you have one, is used
only *after* generation, as an external check with [`madcats validate`](commands/validate.md).

## Quick Example

```bash
# Reconstruct the panel from the vendor design files
madcats design \
  --primers panel_primer_sequence.csv \
  --probe-design panel_probe-design.txt \
  --output reference_tags.csv

# Count alleles in every sample
madcats generate \
  --fastq-dir fastqs/ \
  --reference-tags reference_tags.csv \
  --jobs 8 \
  --output project_MADC.csv
```

## Getting Started

New to MADCATS? Start here:

1. [Installation](getting-started/installation.md): install with pip or download a binary
2. [Quick Start](getting-started/quickstart.md): your first MADC in two commands
3. [Try the Example](getting-started/example.md): run a small simulated project and check it against the truth
4. [Choosing a Workflow](getting-started/workflows.md): which commands your platform and inputs need

## Scope

MADCATS is an independent implementation of the MADC format and does not aim to reproduce any
vendor's table exactly. How closely it agrees, and against which comparators, is recorded in
[Validation & Accuracy](reference/validation.md).
