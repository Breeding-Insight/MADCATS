# Output Formats

## MADC Table

`madcats generate --output` writes a CSV with one row per allele and one integer read-count column
per sample. Rows are grouped by marker and ordered Ref, Alt, RefMatch, AltMatch, Other.

```

### Columns

| Column | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `AlleleID` | Marker name and category joined by a pipe, e.g. `Chr01_000123\|AltMatch`. With `--number-match-ids`, Match/Other rows get a stable serial: `Chr01_000123\|RefMatch_0001` |
| `CloneID` | Marker name |
| `AlleleSequence` | The row's tag sequence |
| `ClusterConsensusSequence` | Canonical rows carry their own sequence; Match/Other rows carry the Ref tag, following vendor convention |
| `CallRate` | Canonical rows: fraction of samples with canonical Ref or Alt reads at the locus. Other rows: `0` |
| `OneRatioRef` … `PICRef` | Vendor downstream statistics, not FASTQ evidence: emitted as `.` |
| `PICSnp` → **`Variants`** | With `--annotations on` (default): the row's events against the Ref tag. Otherwise `.` |
| `AvgPIC` → **`MarkerType`** | With `--annotations on` (default): what the row carries beyond its canonical. Otherwise `.` |
| `AvgCountRef`, `AvgCountSnp` | Canonical rows: nonzero means of the Ref and Alt counts. Other rows: the row's own nonzero mean, in both columns |
| `RatioAvgCountRefAvgCountSnp` | `.` |
| one column per sample | Integer read counts |

Sample columns are named by the FASTQ stem (or a unique `--sample-name-field` from target
manifests), or renamed with `--sample-lookup`.

### Annotations

`--annotations on` (the default) repurposes two statistics columns the pipeline never computes. The
column *positions* are unchanged, so positional consumers see the same 16-column layout.
`--annotations off` restores the exact vendor header and writes no sidecar.

**`MarkerType`** says what the row carries beyond its canonical:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `.` | The Ref row, or a row that only realises an ambiguity code |
| `snp` | Substitutions only (the Alt row of a designed SNP is `snp`) |
| `indel` | Gaps only (the Alt row of a designed indel is `indel`) |
| `both` | Substitutions and gaps |

To keep SNP-only microhaplotypes, drop `indel` and `both` rows by this label.

**`Variants`** lists the row's events against the Ref tag, `;`-separated, in 1-based coordinates on
the tag as printed:

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `91:A>T` | Substitution |
| `55:C>CAAAA` | Insertion, VCF-anchored on the preceding reference base, left-normalised |
| `70:TAG>T` | Deletion |
| `clip=4` | An insertion pushed the last 4 Ref bases out of the window |
| `overhang=3` | A deletion pulled 3 downstream bases into the window |

Example: `55:C>CAAAA;91:A>T;clip=4`. The Ref row is `.`; the Alt row of a designed SNP is exactly the
design (e.g. `46:C>G`).

## Variants Sidecar

`OUTPUT.variants.csv` (with `--annotations on`) lists the same events one per line, keyed by
`CloneID` and sequence so it survives allele-ID renumbering downstream:

| Column | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `CloneID`, `AlleleID`, `AlleleSequence` | Row identity |
| `Position` | 1-based position on the Ref tag |
| `Ref`, `Alt` | Event alleles |
| `Type` | `snp`, `ins`, `del`, `clip` (Ref holds the unobserved bases) or `overhang` (Alt holds the pulled-in bases) |

## QC / Provenance JSON

`OUTPUT.qc.json` records:
- the pipeline version and every parameter
- input paths
- per-sample read accounting: records read, reads assigned, gapped and partial assignments, reads
  in emitted rows, reads moved by denoising, reads dropped and why
- row counts by category, by evidence route, and by `marker_types`
- the variants sidecar path

`normalize-reads`, `infer-design` and `window-scan` write their own QC JSONs; see each command's page.

## Vendor-Style Preamble (HapApp)

`--dart-preamble` prepends the seven starred rows that vendor raw MADCs carry above the header, so
preamble-expecting consumers such as HapApp and HapApp_utils accept the file:

1. service/project label (`--preamble-project`, default: output filename before its first dot)
2. plate barcode
3. plate number
4. plate row
5. plate column
6. plate name
7. `targetid`: the FASTQ-derived sample ids, directly above the header's sample names

Every empty preamble cell is `*`, as in vendor output. The file's first cell holds a full
provenance string (pipeline, version, and every generation parameter as `key=value`), prefixed with
`* ` so consumers that skip starred lines still skip it. No timestamp is included, so output stays
byte-reproducible.

Combine with `--sample-lookup` to rename sample columns while the targetid row keeps the FASTQ ids,
matching the raw vendor layout.

## Downstream Processing

A MADCATS table is a raw MADC. Its allele IDs are per-project (`|RefMatch`, `|AltMatch`, ...) and
are not yet matched to the panel's fixed allele IDs. Run it through HapApp or HapApp_utils
(generate with `--dart-preamble`) before using it in BIGr, updog or other downstream tools. HapApp
assigns the fixed allele IDs and maintains the panel's cross-project allele database; MADCATS does
neither.

polyRAD's `readDArTag` is one example. In polyRAD 2.0.1 it rejects raw MADCs, from MADCATS or the
vendor: Match rows share allele IDs, and the statistics columns are read as samples. It does read
the processed layout (unique allele IDs, then `AlleleID`, `CloneID`, `AlleleSequence` and the sample
columns).

The tested path is MADCATS → HapApp_utils (fixed allele IDs) → `BIGr::madc2vcf_all()` → updog.
Genotypes from this path agreed with independent reference genotypes at 98.42% on GT-seq and
95.13% on the 192-sample capture cohort.

HapApp's fixed-allele-ID step keeps only columns 1–3 and the sample columns, so the `Variants` and
`MarkerType` annotations do not carry through it. Use the `OUTPUT.variants.csv` sidecar if you need
them later.
