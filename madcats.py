"""MADCATS — Marker-Anchored Discovery and Counting of Alleles from Targeted Sequencing.

A platform-independent tool for recovering design-specified alleles and
discovering additional alleles from targeted sequencing reads, with MADC
and VCF-ready output.  The name also reflects the tool's origins as a
FASTQ-to-MADC workflow, where MADC denotes the Missing Allele Discovery
Counts format.

The implementation intentionally uses only the Python standard library.

Seven subcommands cover the read models the pipeline understands:

- ``design`` reconstructs each marker's canonical Ref/Alt tags from vendor
  primer + probe-design files.  This is the primer-started, single-end model
  (DArTag-style): every read begins with a synthesized primer, so the assay
  itself fixes the tag and the design files describe it exactly.
- ``infer-design`` recovers the same panel definition from the probe design
  plus FASTQ evidence alone, for when the primer file is unavailable.  The
  tag must be a tag-length window of the expanded target that contains the
  variant, so inference selects among a closed candidate set — exact
  read-prefix votes first, a flagged fuzzy tier for diverged loci.
- ``merge-pairs`` collapses overlapping paired-end reads into single
  fragments before normalization (quality-picked overlap bases; engulfed
  read-through geometry discards adapter tails by construction).  Paired
  data whose mates cannot overlap (dual-anchored capture designs) is
  instead pooled — both mates fed as independent reads — an explicit
  per-run decision made from measured geometry, never auto-detected.
- ``normalize-reads`` adapts platforms whose reads are neither oriented nor
  primer-started (AgriSeq-style bidirectional amplicons): each read is
  located against the design targets by k-mer, oriented forward, and a
  fixed-length window containing the variant is excised into pipeline-ready
  FASTQs plus a matching window panel.  Unlike a primer-defined tag, the
  window is an analytical choice, not a physical one — so later runs of the
  same panel must freeze it with ``--reuse-tags``, keeping microhaplotype
  sequences comparable across runs (an identical sequence must mean
  identical biology, never a moved window).  Markers may share a physical
  locus (``LocusGroup``): tiles share one k-mer territory, reads route
  among member windows (``--group-routing``), and member windows are
  forced to excise distinct sequences.
- ``window-scan`` sweeps candidate tag lengths on a sample subset and
  reports the three selection curves — retention, cleanliness, and
  microhaplotype information — with a recommended length, so the
  window-size choice is made from the project's own reads instead of an
  external truth comparison.
- ``generate`` turns per-sample FASTQs plus a panel from any of the three
  panel routes above into the MADC table, via the stages listed below.
- ``validate`` compares a generated MADC against a reference MADC row-by-row
  and cell-by-cell, reporting precision/recall by allele category.

Pipeline stages (the ``generate`` command; see ``run_generate``):

1. Panel definition.  Reconstruct each marker's canonical Ref/Alt tags either
   from the DArTag primer + probe-design files (``build_panel``) or from a
   platform-neutral reference-tag CSV (``load_reference_tags``).  The tags are
   the ground truth every later stage measures reads against, so this stage
   validates aggressively and fails loudly on design inconsistencies.
2. Per-sample read processing (``process_sample``).  Assign each read to one
   locus by its left-primer prefix (``PrimerIndex`` trie), keep the fixed-
   length tag, and accept it within the substitution-only identity envelope
   of the locus's Ref/Alt tags — or, when every candidate rejects it, under
   one gapped reading within the same edit budget, so undesigned indel
   haplotypes are counted rather than dropped (``select_marker``).  Tags
   carrying an N are credited to the one N-free sequence they fit or
   dropped; they never become rows.  Counting exact observed sequences —
   never consensus-corrected ones — is what makes the output auditable
   against the raw FASTQs.  Results are cached per sample
   keyed by panel + read-processing parameters, because this stage is the
   only expensive one and downstream thresholds do not invalidate it.
3. Partial-read salvage (``apply_partial_reads``).  On by default; credits a
   primer-assigned short read to the one already-learned full tag it is a
   prefix of, and only when it is longer than every prefix two of the locus's
   alleles share, so truncated reads can support but never invent alleles or
   move an allele ratio.
4. Evidence collection (``collect_evidence`` under an ``EvidenceRule``).
   A novel sequence earns an output row through reproducibility across
   samples, single-sample depth, or optional whole-tag quality.  The same
   rule drives stages 5 and 6, so protection, discovery, and emission can
   never disagree about which sequences are real.
5. Denoising (``finalize_counts``).  UNOISE-style abundance-skew absorption
   of likely sequencing errors into their parent sequences within each
   sample, then a pooled pass that folds an evidence-failing sequence into
   the protected parent the project-wide skew names — only when both carry
   the same target allele, so no move can change a sample's dosage.
   Evidence-passing and canonical sequences are protected from absorption;
   absorbed reads move to their parent row rather than disappearing, and
   the moves are reported in QC.
6. Emission (``write_madc``).  Every panel locus always emits its canonical
   Ref and Alt rows — even at zero reads — because downstream dosage tools
   need the biallelic axis present unconditionally.  Novel rows must pass
   the evidence rule; excluded reads are tallied, never silently dropped.
7. QC/provenance.  A JSON sidecar records inputs, parameters, panel
   fingerprints, per-sample QC, and a full read-accounting ledger from raw
   records through emitted rows, so any run can be audited and reproduced.

Reading map.  The file is laid out in the order a read travels; each
section opens with a banner comment:

0. Constants, errors and data types (``Locus``, ``Sample``, ``SampleResult``).
1. Sequence and file utilities (IUPAC matching, mismatch counts, CSV/FASTQ
   helpers).
2. Alignment engine: the Myers prescreen, the banded DP, and
   ``accepted_gapped_reading``/``row_reading`` — the one gapped reading a
   row may be given.
3. Panel definition: design-file reconstruction, reference-tag tables, and
   primer-free inference.
4. Platform intake: pair merging, window location and freezing, tiling and
   routing, window-scan.
5. Per-sample read assignment: ``PrimerIndex``, ``select_marker``,
   ``process_sample`` and its cache.
6. Evidence, denoising and partial-read salvage: ``EvidenceRule``,
   ``collect_evidence``, ``finalize_counts``, ``apply_partial_reads``.
7. Classification and annotation: ``classify_sequence``, ``variant_events``,
   ``marker_type_label``.
8. MADC input/output and QC: ``read_madc``, ``write_madc``, ``validate_madc``.
9. Commands and command line: one ``run_*`` per subcommand, ``build_parser``.

Vocabulary.  *tag*: the fixed-length sequence a read is measured as (intake
code also says *window*, the position of that sequence on a longer read);
*marker* and *locus*: the same panel entry (``Locus`` is the record);
*canonical*: the design's Ref and Alt tags; *category*: Ref, Alt, RefMatch,
AltMatch or Other, read at the target base.

    - depth route: at least ``depth_min_reads`` reads within one sample, so a

def run_window_scan(args: argparse.Namespace) -> int:
    """Sweep candidate tag lengths and report the three selection curves.

    Window length trades three measurable quantities, and until now the
    trade was settled per platform against external truth (vendor calls or
    a reference VCF).  This diagnostic computes the same decision from the
    project's own reads:

    - retention: fraction of located reads fully covering the best window
      at each length.  Predicted for a dense length grid from ONE coverage
      pass (read span classes make it arithmetic), and measured exactly for
      each candidate length by a real normalize pass.
    - cleanliness: of assigned reads, the fraction NOT absorbed by
      denoising and NOT dropped as failed evidence — per-base error and
      indel exposure accumulate with length, so this falls (and cliffs on
      homopolymer chemistries).
    - information: evidence-passing novel (Match) rows per 100 markers —
      microhaplotype diversity captured; rises with length until the local
      linked variation is exhausted, then saturates.

    Information leads the eye but cannot lead the decision: systematic
    errors (Ion homopolymer indel families recur across samples) pass the
    reproducibility route and inflate the information curve with false
    Match rows, and an information-weighted score follows them long —
    measured on Ion oyster data, where such a score recommended 81 bp
    against the externally validated 41-bp knee.  The recommendation is
    therefore SURVIVAL-FIRST: survival = retention x assignment x
    cleanliness; candidates within ``--info-band`` of the best survival
    are eligible, and the eligible candidate with the most information
    wins (ties break short).  On the four benchmarked platforms this rule
    reproduces every externally validated choice.  The report also names
    the information-saturation length (smallest candidate reaching >= 95%
    of maximum information).  Each candidate runs the real
    normalize-reads -> generate machinery on a sample subset
    (``--scan-samples``: the first files in sorted order, or a random draw
    with ``--scan-seed``; ``--generate-args`` forwards evidence flags), so
    every number in the table is the pipeline's
    own accounting, not a model.  Dense-grid prediction skips the
    tile-dedup guard (prediction only); candidate runs enforce it, and a
    candidate the guard refuses (tiles inseparable at that length) is
    reported as failed rather than aborting the sweep.

    ``--scan-draws N`` repeats the whole sweep on N independent seeded sample
    draws (seeds ``--scan-seed``, +1, +2, ...) and reports each draw's
    recommendation and their agreement: a recommendation that flips between
    draws is a property of the sample subset, not of the panel, and a user
    without external truth has no other way to see that.
